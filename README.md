# PyTorch-Learning 🚀

This repository contains my complete learning journey with **PyTorch**, including basics, experiments, model training pipelines, and hands-on deep learning practice.  
The repo is structured to help me grow from fundamentals → full training workflows → advanced ML concepts.

## 📘 Contents

### **1️⃣ basics/**  
Small, focused Python files to understand key PyTorch concepts:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tensors.py` | Tensor creation, operations, GPU usage |
| `autograd.py` | Autograd, gradients, computation graph |
| `simple_nn.py` | Building a basic neural network |
| `dataloader.py` | Custom dataset + DataLoader |
| `gradients.py` | Manual gradient understanding |
| More files will be added as I continue learning |
